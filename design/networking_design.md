# MinOS Networking Stack Design

## Overview
The MinOS networking stack is designed to be minimalistic, secure, and efficient, providing only essential networking capabilities required for a command-line operating system. This document outlines the architecture and components of the MinOS networking subsystem.

## Design Goals
- Minimal resource usage and overhead
- Strong security by default
- Support for essential protocols only
- Efficient implementation for CLI-based workflows
- Reliable operation in various network environments

## Network Architecture
- Modular, layered design
- User-space implementation for most components
- Minimal kernel-space components for performance
- Secure by default configuration
- Isolation between network services

## Core Components

### Protocol Support
- TCP/IP (IPv4 and IPv6) with minimal feature set
- UDP for lightweight communications
- ICMP for network diagnostics
- DNS client for name resolution
- SSH for secure remote access
- SFTP for secure file transfer
- Optional: DHCP client for network configuration

### Network Interface Management
- Support for common wired and wireless interfaces
- Minimal driver footprint
- Interface configuration and monitoring
- Dynamic and static IP addressing
- Basic routing capabilities

### Firewall
- Built-in stateful packet filtering
- Default deny-all policy
- Simple rule configuration via CLI
- Connection tracking for stateful filtering
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

### Security Features
- No default open ports
- All services disabled by default
- Encrypted communications (SSH/TLS)
- Protection against common network attacks
- Network isolation capabilities

### Network Utilities
- Minimal set of diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute, etc.)
- Network configuration utilities
- Connection monitoring tools
- Bandwidth usage tracking

## Implementation Details
- Written in C for performance
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Comprehensive testing for security
- Minimal dependencies on external libraries

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for low latency
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient packet processing
- Reduced protocol overhead
- Asynchronous I/O where beneficial

## Security Measures
- Regular security audits
- Secure default configurations
- Principle of least privilege
- Network activity monitoring
- Automatic security updates

## Future Extensions
- VPN client support
- Additional protocol support as needed
- Enhanced network diagnostics
- Traffic shaping capabilities

## Limitations
- Limited support for advanced networking features
- No built-in network services (web server, etc.)
- Focused on essential operations only
- Limited GUI tools for network management
