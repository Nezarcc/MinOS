# MinOS Boot System Design

## Overview
The MinOS boot system is designed to be fast, secure, and minimalistic, providing only the essential functionality needed to initialize the system and load the kernel. This document outlines the architecture and components of the MinOS boot process.

## Design Goals
- Minimal boot time
- Secure boot process
- Small memory and storage footprint
- Reliability and error recovery
- Support for various hardware platforms

## Boot Sequence

### Stage 1: Firmware/BIOS
- System firmware initializes hardware
- Performs basic hardware checks
- Loads the bootloader from storage

### Stage 2: Bootloader
- Minimalistic bootloader (custom or modified GRUB/LILO)
- Loads kernel and initial ramdisk
- Passes control to kernel with minimal parameters
- Supports Secure Boot verification

### Stage 3: Kernel Initialization
- Kernel initializes core subsystems
- Sets up memory management
- Initializes process scheduler
- Mounts root filesystem

### Stage 4: Init Process
- First user-space process
- Starts essential system services
- Initializes user environment
- Completes boot to operational state

## Core Components

### Bootloader
- Small, efficient bootloader
- Support for multiple boot configurations
- Minimal user interface for boot options
- Cryptographic verification of kernel and initramfs
- Support for both BIOS and UEFI systems

### Initial RAM Disk (initramfs)
- Minimal set of tools and drivers
- Essential for mounting the root filesystem
- Contains only necessary modules and utilities
- Optimized for fast loading and execution

### Init System
- Lightweight init process
- Sequential service startup for predictability
- Dependency-based initialization where necessary
- Minimal service management capabilities
- Fast transition to operational state

## Security Features
- Secure Boot integration
- Kernel and bootloader signature verification
- Boot parameter validation
- Protection against unauthorized modifications
- Tamper detection mechanisms

## Performance Optimizations
- Parallel initialization where possible
- Lazy loading of non-essential components
- Optimized disk I/O during boot
- Reduced hardware detection overhead
- Minimal logging during boot process

## Implementation Details
- Written in C and assembly for critical sections
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Comprehensive testing for reliability
- Fallback mechanisms for boot failures

## Future Extensions
- Enhanced recovery options
- Additional hardware platform support
- Advanced boot diagnostics
- Optional graphical boot splash (minimal)

## Limitations
- Limited hardware auto-detection
- Minimal boot configuration options
- Focused on essential boot functionality only
