# MinOS Package Management Design

## Overview
The MinOS package management system is designed to be lightweight, secure, and efficient, providing only essential functionality for managing software packages. This document outlines the architecture and components of the MinOS package management system.

## Design Goals
- Minimal resource usage and overhead
- Strong security for package verification
- Simple and intuitive package operations
- Efficient dependency management
- Support for statically linked binaries

## Package Management Architecture
- Minimalistic package manager implementation
- Secure package repository infrastructure
