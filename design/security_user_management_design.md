# MinOS Security & User Management Design

## Overview
The MinOS security and user management system is designed to provide robust protection with minimal overhead, implementing the principle of least privilege throughout the operating system. This document outlines the architecture and components of the MinOS security framework.

## Design Goals
- Strong security with minimal resource usage
- Comprehensive access control system
- Protection against common attack vectors
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- System integrity verification and protection

## Security Architecture
- Defense-in-depth approach
- Layered security controls
- Minimal attack surface
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default configuration

## Core Components

### User Authentication
- Modern password hashing (Argon2 or bcrypt)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Secure credential storage
- Login attempt limiting and monitoring
- Session management and timeout controls

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
- Fine-grained permission management
- Mandatory Access Control options
- Resource usage quotas and limits
- Privilege escalation controls

### Process Isolation
- Strong process boundaries
- Memory protection between processes
- Sandboxing for critical applications
- Resource isolation and control
- Capability-based security model

### System Integrity
- Secure boot chain
- File integrity monitoring
- Immutable system files option
- Runtime integrity checking
- Tamper detection mechanisms

### Audit and Logging
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Secure log storage and transmission
- Log analysis tools
- Anomaly detection capabilities
- Compliance reporting features

### Update Management
- Secure package verification
- Automated security updates
- Rollback capabilities
- Update integrity verification
- Minimal downtime during updates

## Implementation Details
- Written in C with security-focused coding practices
- Formal verification for critical components
- Comprehensive security testing
- Regular security audits and reviews
- Minimal dependencies on external libraries

## Security Hardening Measures
- Reduced default permissions
- Removal of unnecessary services
- Kernel hardening techniques
- Network service restrictions
- Regular security patches

## User Management
- Minimal but complete user account management
- Group-based permission system
- User environment configuration
- Resource usage monitoring and limits
- Account lifecycle management

## Future Extensions
- Enhanced intrusion detection
- Additional authentication methods
- Advanced threat analytics
- Security policy management tools

## Limitations
- Limited support for enterprise identity systems
- Focused on essential security features only
- Minimal graphical security management tools
