# MinOS File System Design

## Overview
The MinOS file system is designed to be minimalistic, secure, and reliable while maintaining high performance. It provides essential file operations with strong security controls and data integrity features.

## Design Goals
- Minimal resource usage and overhead
- Strong security through permissions and encryption
- Data integrity and crash recovery
- Efficient operations for CLI-based workflows
- Support for both persistent and volatile storage

## File System Architecture
- Hierarchical structure with simplified implementation
- Based on a lightweight variant of ext4 or custom implementation
- Optimized for small file operations common in CLI environments
- Minimal metadata overhead
- Support for both spinning disks and solid-state storage

## Core Features

### File Operations
- Basic operations: create, read, write, delete
- Efficient directory traversal
- Symbolic and hard links
- File locking mechanisms
- Atomic operations where possible

### Permission System
- UNIX-style permission model with enhancements
- User, group, and other permission levels
- Access control lists (ACLs) for fine-grained control
- Extended attributes for additional metadata
- Immutable file flags for system files

### Encryption
- Per-directory or per-file encryption options
- Transparent encryption for home directories
- Modern encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Key management system with secure storage
- Integration with user authentication

### Journaling
- Lightweight journaling for crash recovery
- Transaction-based operations for critical changes
- Optimized for minimal performance impact
- Configurable journaling levels (metadata-only or full)
- Fast recovery procedures

### Mount Points and Volumes
- Support for multiple volumes and mount points
- Removable media handling
- Network file system integration (minimal)
- RAM disk support for temporary storage

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for small files and sequential access
- Minimal caching for reduced memory footprint
- Efficient directory indexing
- Reduced metadata overhead
- Asynchronous writes with integrity guarantees

## Security Features
- Strict permission enforcement
- Path traversal protection
- Secure deletion options
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Tamper-evident logging

## Implementation Details
- Written in C for performance
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Comprehensive testing for data integrity
- Minimal dependencies on external libraries

## Future Extensions
- Optional network file system support
- Enhanced encryption features
- Additional backup and snapshot capabilities
- Deduplication for storage efficiency

## Limitations
- Not optimized for very large files or databases
- Limited support for advanced file system features
- Focused on essential operations only
