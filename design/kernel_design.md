# MinOS Kernel Architecture Design

## Overview
The MinOS kernel is designed to be a minimalistic, high-performance microkernel that provides only essential services while maintaining strong security and reliability. This document outlines the architecture, components, and design decisions for the MinOS kernel.

## Design Goals
- Minimal memory and resource footprint
- Fast boot time and runtime performance
- Strong security through isolation
- Reliability and stability
- Portability across hardware platforms

## Kernel Type
MinOS uses a microkernel architecture with the following characteristics:
- Only essential services run in kernel space (memory management, process scheduling, IPC)
- Device drivers, file systems, and networking run in user space
- Message-passing for inter-process communication
- Minimal attack surface for enhanced security

## Core Components

### Process Management
- Lightweight process creation and termination
- Efficient thread scheduling optimized for CLI workloads
- Process isolation through memory protection
- Minimal context switching overhead
- Priority-based scheduling with anti-starvation mechanisms

### Memory Management
- Simple but efficient virtual memory system
- Demand paging with minimal overhead
- Memory protection between processes
- Small memory footprint for kernel itself
- Support for memory-constrained environments

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Message-passing primitives for communication
- Synchronous and asynchronous communication channels
- Capability-based security for IPC
- Efficient implementation with minimal copying

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Minimal hardware abstraction for portability
- Support for x86_64 and ARM architectures
- Basic device driver interfaces
- Power management primitives

### System Calls
- Minimal set of system calls
- Efficient syscall implementation
- Security checks on all system calls
- Well-defined interfaces for user space services

## Security Features
- Principle of least privilege
- Process isolation and sandboxing
- Memory protection and address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Secure boot integration
- Kernel hardening techniques

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized critical paths
- Minimal locking and synchronization
- Efficient memory allocation
- Reduced context switching overhead
- Cache-friendly data structures

## Implementation Details
- Written in C with assembly for critical sections
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Static analysis and verification tools used during development
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Future Extensions
- Optional real-time scheduling capabilities
- Support for additional hardware architectures
- Enhanced virtualization capabilities
- Advanced power management features

## Limitations
- No support for graphical interfaces
- Limited hardware support (focused on essential devices)
- Not designed for systems requiring extensive device support
