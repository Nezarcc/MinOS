# MinOS Design Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the MinOS architecture and design principles. Detailed specifications for each component are available in their respective design documents.

## System Architecture

MinOS follows a layered architecture with the following primary components:

1. **Kernel Layer** - The core of the operating system, responsible for hardware abstraction, process management, and memory management.
2. **System Services Layer** - Essential system services including file system, networking, and security.
3. **Shell Layer** - The command-line interface and user interaction components.
4. **Application Layer** - Minimal set of core utilities and user applications.

## Design Principles

### Minimalism
- Every component must justify its existence and resource usage
- No redundant functionality
- Simplified interfaces with focused functionality

### Performance
- Optimized for speed and efficiency
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast boot times and responsive operation

### Security
- Security-first design approach
- Principle of least privilege
- Strong isolation between components
- Secure by default configurations

### Reliability
- Fail-safe mechanisms
- Predictable behavior
- Robust error handling
- Journaling and recovery capabilities

### Portability
- Architecture-agnostic design where possible
- Minimal hardware requirements
- Support for virtualized environments

### Extensibility
- Well-defined interfaces for extensions
- Plugin architecture for optional components
- Clear separation between core and extended functionality

## Component Interaction

MinOS components interact through well-defined interfaces with strict access controls. The system employs a message-passing architecture for inter-process communication, minimizing shared state and enhancing security.

## Development Approach

The development of MinOS follows these principles:

1. **Incremental Development** - Build and test core components first, then add additional functionality
2. **Continuous Testing** - Rigorous testing of all components
3. **Security Reviews** - Regular security audits and reviews
4. **Performance Benchmarking** - Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation of all components and interfaces

## Implementation Considerations

- C language for kernel and core components
- Assembly for performance-critical sections
- Shell scripting for system utilities
- Static linking preferred over dynamic linking
- Minimal external dependencies
