# MinOS - Minimalistic Command-Line Operating System

## Overview
MinOS (pronounced "Minus") is an ultra-lightweight, secure, and fast operating system that provides only the essential features needed for an efficient and robust CLI-based environment. Designed for power users, developers, and embedded systems, MinOS maintains a minimal footprint while delivering strong security and performance.

## Core Principles
1. **Minimalism** – No unnecessary features, no bloat, and an ultra-light system.
2. **Speed** – Optimized kernel and utilities for maximum efficiency.
3. **Security** – Hardened system architecture with strong user controls.
4. **Reliability** – Fail-safe mechanisms to ensure system stability.
5. **Portability** – Designed to run on low-spec devices, virtual machines, and embedded systems.
6. **Extensibility** – Allows users to add custom functionalities while keeping the base system minimal.
